# SPX
SPX (Systems Programming Exchange) is a marketplace that enables highly sought after computer components to be traded amongst seasoned computer programmers. Traditionally, trading is inperson, however due to COVID-19 restrictions trading must now be done remotely. We implemented a new system for SPX that allows trading to take place electronically. This consists of two parts, the exchange (handles orders) and an auto-trader (a program which trades based on predefined conditions).
